## 10 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE

1.Any disagreements between the Parties shall first be ne-
gotiated. To this end, the Parties shall provide written
acknowledgment to any letter from another Party con-
cerning a disagreement, as well as devote reasonable
time to resolve the disagreement in person or through
a senior representative of the Parties in disagreement.

2.If the Client (or a single Apartment Owner) has com-
plaints about the Contractor (for example on the Com-
fort Standards or on the amount of Energy Savings, or
in general on the implemented Measures and provided
Energy Efficiency Services), the latter shall directly or
via the Manager notify the Contractor thereof. The Con-
tractor shall verify and prepare a Statement of the com-
plaint and remedy the problems that have occurred. If
the problem persists for more than 20 (twenty) Business
days from the notification the Client shall arrange a com-
mittee comprised of duly authorized representatives of
the Contractor, the Manager and the Client to meet and
to prepare a draft Statement based on the complaint and
facts verified on the site or undertake any other fact-
finding procedure according to the mediation rules avail-
able on the Sunshine platform - sunshineplatform.eu.

3.If the Contractor has complaints about the Client (for
example for damaging installed equipment), the latter
shall notify the Client and the Manager thereof. The
Client shall verify and possibly identify the perpetrator
and prepare a Statement of the complaint and remedy
the problems that have occurred. If the problem per-
sists for more than 30 days from notification, the Con-
tractor shall arrange a committee comprised of duly au-
thorized representatives of the Contractor, the Manager
and the Client to meet and to prepare a draft Statement
based on the complaint and facts verified on the site or

undertake any other fact-finding procedure according
to the mediation rules available on the EPC-platform-
http://sunshineplatform.eu.

4.For the fact-finding procedure applicable in case of dis-
putes pertaining to facts, the following shall apply:

(a)The actual Comfort Standards (ambient tempera-
ture of the individual Apartments in the Building)
shall be considered duly recorded if the tempera-
ture measurements are conducted by an indepen-
dent certified energy auditor (according to MK Nr.
382) and in compliance with LVS EN 12599 stan-
dard. The Statement shall be executed based on the
findings measured by the independent certified en-
ergy auditor;
(b)General problems with the implemented Measures,
like for example malfunctioning equipment and/or
defect and damages made to the Measures, or with
the calculation of the Energy Savings, shall be con-
sidered duly recorded if reported by an indepen-
dent expert like a certified energy auditor (accord-
ing to MK Nr. 382);
(c)All Parties shall be notified at least 5 (five) Busi-
ness days before any measurement made by a third
party. An authorized representative of the Parties
has the right to participate in the measurement pro-
cess for the preparation of the Statement. The ab-
sence of the Authorized representatives of any of
the Parties is not an obstacle to the preparation and
execution of the Statement by the Parties;
(d)The signing of the Statement by any of the Parties
shall not be considered as an acknowledgment of
a breach under this Agreement and/or shall not be
deemed as a waiver of any of the Parties’ rights and
obligation hereunder. The costs for the indepen-
dent third parties shall be evenly shared between
the Parties;
(e)One copy of each Statement executed shall be de-
livered to the Contractor, the Manager and the
Apartment Owner having filed the complaint.

5.If the Parties fail to reach an agreement, the Parties
shall enter into a formal mediation process according
to the mediation rules available on the EPC-platform-
[http://sunshineplatform.eu,](http://sunshineplatform.eu,) effective during the validity period of
the Agreement and as existing at the time of the dis-
pute. If there is a dispute between the Parties regarding
technical issues, any Party may request the dispute on
established facts to be resolved pursuant to the procedu-
ral rules of the fact-finding committee available on the
Sunshine platform - sunshineplatform.eu.

6.If the Parties fail to reach a mutual agreement after the
mediation process and/or fact-finding process the dis-
pute shall be resolved by a court of general jurisdiction
of Latvia in accordance with applicable laws and regula-
tions effective in Latvia. An application shall be lodged
at the court according to the jurisdiction of the defen-
dant’s place of residence or registered address; however,
if it is not Latvia, then at the Riga City Centre District
